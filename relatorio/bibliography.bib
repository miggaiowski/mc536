@Book{indiano,
    abstract = {\_Database Management Systems\_ provides comprehensive and up-to-date coverage
of the fundamentals of database systems. Coherent explanations and practical
examples have made this one of the leading texts in the field. The third
edition continues in this tradition, enhancing it with more practical
material.

The new edition has been reorganized to allow more flexibility in the way the
course is taught. Now, instructors can easily choose whether they would like
to teach a course which emphasizes database application development or a
course that emphasizes database systems issues. New overview chapters at the
beginning of parts make it possible to skip other chapters in the part if you
don't want the detail.

More applications and examples have been added throughout the book, including
SQL and Oracle examples. The applied flavor is further enhanced by the two new
database applications chapters.},
